This project implements a lexical analyzer and a recursive descent parser for a (sort of) subset of C language called SUBC.
The grammar for the language is given in 'Grammar.txt'

The lexical rules for SUBC are included in 'lex rules.docx'.
      
Sample test programs and their trees are provided in the folder 'tiny_test_progs'
